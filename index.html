						<p>Data Scientist | Data Analyst</p>
						<p>"Data is everywhere but becomes meaningful only when one can tell stories/provide actionable insights"</p>
						<p>I am a graduate student at RWTH Aachen University in the field of Analytics and Data Science. I have 2.5+ years of experience as a Data Analyst in the field of Healthcare analytics with a focus on patient and product analytics. I have hands-on experience in PL/SQL, Python, Big Data Technologies (Hive, Impala, Spark SQL), Oracle, MySQL, MS Excel.
						My journey in analytics started when i joined IQVIA. It was a great learning curve for me and it helped me gain some real world data analytics experience. I truly believe that gaining valuable work experience improves your understanding of the field of study, opportuinity to learn from leaders and explore career paths. Hence, I am interested in working student/internship roles in the areas of analytics & data science.
